# National-Health-and-Nutrition-Examination-Survey-Data

Our project output includes a redesigned database and a Metabase Dashboard for business
analytics. Both of them will provide valuable benefits for our customers and the NCHS itself.
Through the reorganized database and newly-designed metabase dashboard, it would be more
convenient for doctors and researchers to access and make use of these survey results, and more
research findings may come out. Especially with the development of the dashboard, the medical
professionals can easily do analytics and generate insights. For the NCHS, itâ€™s also easier for the
internal usage and provide a good frame for the future data management. As observed, NCHS
did the survey each year, so the new data framework can provide guidance for the survey results
management, and the dashboard is easy for NCHS to visualize the survey results.
